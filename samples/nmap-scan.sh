# This is just an example.
#
# Since scanning many networks can produce huge XML files,
# the idea is to create one XML file per network, then
# use all of them as input to nbs.nmap.Nmap().
#
# If you scan few networks with few hosts or if you just
# want to experiment, feel free to use the `-iL` option of
# Nmap, passing a list of all networks and hosts to be
# scanned.
#
# If you have a large number of networks, use the mapfile option.
# In order to use mapfile, populate your networks, one per line,
# in a file called networks.txt.
#
# If you have a small number of networks, comment out the mapfile
# lines, and uncomment the "small array" line.
#
# For the purpose of this example, assume that netbox-scanner
# is configured to use the same directory of this script
# to look for XML files.
